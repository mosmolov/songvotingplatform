# Song Voting Application

## What Is It
This is a React.js web application created to allow high school students to vote on which song is played over the PA system each day. Each day, a script runs that fetches 3 random songs from the API. Then, users can vote for their favorite song, and the admin can track changes and votes through the React Admin dashboard.
